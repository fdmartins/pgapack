This directory contains the FORTRAN source code of a battery of 18
unconstrained minimization problems and a program to run them.  These problems
are the 18 listed on page 30 of the following article:

More, Jorge J., Burton S. Garbow, and Kenneth E. Hillstrom.  "Testing
	Unconstrained Optimization Software."  ACM Transactions on
	Mathematical Software, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 1981.  Pages 17-41.

Summary from article:
Desc is the index into the description of the functions, fmin are the
known minima. The numbers n, m are the dimensionality of the problem: n
is the number of variables (the dimension) m is the number of terms in
the function. It is unclear from the user interface of the program how n
and m are effected by the dimension choice.
