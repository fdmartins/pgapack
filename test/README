TEST README
===========

This directory contains various tests. By default the ``test`` make target
runs a test for each of the ``.data`` files and produces a ``.vrfy``
file as a result. For all but the ``instverf.vrfy`` the ``.vrfy`` files
should be empty if everything was ok. The ``instverf.vrfy`` file
contains the output of the instverf run. It contains five lines
indicating a successful test at the end if everything went ok. The
program internally compares the data against the instverf.data file.

Note that for unusual architectures, all tests may fail: The internal
random number generator may produce different random numbers for other
sizes of data types. For typical 32-bit or 64-bit architectures all
tests should pass.

Except for instverf, all ``.data`` files contain the calling sequence
used to produce the test output: The name consists of several fields
delimited by ``_``. The first field contains the name of the directory
in the examples directory where we find the test. The second field has
the name of the test-program. All other parameters are passed to
standard-input of the test program: These all ask several questions on
the command line.

instverf
--------

A simple program to test the accuracy of an installation.  It runs five
distinct genetic algorithms, and stores the results from each.  After all
five are run, it will compare the computed results to those known to be
correct, stored on disk as "instverf.data".  If any errors are found, the
problem number is reported.

The problems tested are
	0:	Binary datatype
	1:	Integer datatype
	2:	Character datatype
	3:	Real datatype
	4:	Binary datatype using PGAGetRealFrom*


instverf.c will run several GA's, one for each native datatype, and check
the output computed versus that stored on disk.  If any differences are
found, it will give a warning.

These programs are the development testing suite.
