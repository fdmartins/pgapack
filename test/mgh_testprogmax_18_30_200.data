 The following is a list of the test functions this program supports.
 The number in parentheses after the name of the function is the
 dimension of the problem.  If the dimension is not a constant (i.e.,
 problems # 6-9, 13 - 15, and 18), the limitations on the dimension
 follow in parentheses after the function name.

 1.  Helical Valley Function (3)
 2.  Biggs EXP6 function (6)
 3.  Gaussian Function (3)
 4.  Powell Badly Scaled Function (2)
 5.  Box Three-Dimensional Function (3)
 6.  Variably-dimentioned Function (variable)
 7.  Watson Function (2 - 31)
 8.  Penalty function I (variable)
 9.  Penalty function II (variable)
 10.  Brown Badly Scaled Function (2)
 11.  Brown and Dennis Function (4)
 12.  Gulf Research And Development Function (3)
 13.  Trigonometric Function (variable)
 14.  Extended Rosenbrock Function (even)
 15.  Extended Powell Singular Function (multiple of 4)
 16.  Beale Function (2)
 17.  Wood Function (4)
 18.  Chebyquad Function (variable less than 51)

 You will need to enter both the problem number and the dimension of the
 problem.  For problems with a constant dimension, use the number in
 parenthesis.  For problems with variable dimension, make sure the
 dimension that you choose falls within the stated limitations AND is
 less than or equal to 100.  For example, to select the Watson function
 with dimension twelve, enter the following: 7 12
